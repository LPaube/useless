                    <p>HTML is not a programming language; it is a markup language that defines the structure of your
                        content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different
                        parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags
                        can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font
                        bigger or smaller, and so on. For example, take the following line of content:</p>
                    <code class="code-center">My cat is very grumpy</code>
                    <p>If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it
                        in paragraph tags:</p>
                    <pre class="code-center">&lt;p>My cat is very grumpy&lt;/p></pre>

                <article>
                    <p>The main parts of our element are as follows:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>The opening tag:</strong> This consists of the name of the element (in this case,
                            p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or
                            starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.</li>
                        <li><strong>The closing tag:</strong> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it
                            includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in
                            this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard
                            beginner errors and can lead to strange results.</li>
                        <li><strong>The content:</strong> This is the content of the element, which in this case, is
                            just text.</li>
                        <li><strong>The element:</strong> The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together
                            comprise the element.</li>
                    </ol>

                <article>
                    <p>You can put elements inside other elements too — this is called nesting. If we wanted to state
                        that our cat is very grumpy, we could wrap the word "very" in a <code>&lt;strong></code>
                        element, which means that the word is to be strongly emphasized:</p>
                    <pre class="code-center">&lt;p>My cat is &lt;strong>very&lt;/strong> grumpy.&lt;/p></pre>
                    <p>You do however need to make sure that your elements are properly nested. In the example above, we
                        opened the &lt;p> element first, then the &lt;strong> element; therefore, we have to close the
                        &lt;strong> element first, then the &lt;p> element. The following is incorrect:</p>
                    <pre class="code-center">&lt;p>My cat is &lt;strong>very grumpy.&lt;/p>&lt;/strong></pre>

                <header class="header-section">Empty Elements</header>
                <article>
                    <p>Some elements have no content and are called empty elements. Take the &lt;img> element that we
                        already have in our HTML page:</p>
                    <pre class="code-center">&lt;img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image"></pre>
                    <p>This contains two attributes, but there is no closing </img> tag and no inner content. This is
                        because an image element doesn't wrap content to affect it. Its purpose is to embed an image in
                        the HTML page in the place it appears.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>Let's go over the various elements of the following code example:</p>
                    <pre class="code-center">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html>
&lt;html>
    &lt;head>
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8">
    &lt;title>My test page&lt;/title>
&lt;/head>
    &lt;body>
    &lt;img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image">
&lt;/body>
&lt;/html>
</pre>
                    <p>Here, we have the following: </p>
                    <code class="code-center">&lt;!DOCTYPE html></code>
                    <p> --- doctype. It is a required preamble. In the mists of time, when HTML was young
                        (around 1991/92), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML
                        page had to follow to be considered good HTML, which could mean automatic error checking
                        and other useful things. However these days, they don't do much and are basically just
                        needed to make sure your document behaves correctly. That's all you need to know for
                        now.</p>
                    <code class=code-center>&lt;html>&lt;/html></code>
                    <p> --- the <code>&lt;html></code> element. This element wraps all the content on the entire
                        page and is sometimes known as the root element...</p>
                </article>
            </section>
            <section id="images" class="main-section">
                <header class="header-section">Images</header>
                <article>
                    <p>Let's turn our attention to the <code>&lt;img></code> element again:</p>
                    <pre class="code-center">&lt;img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image"></pre>
                    <p>As we said before, it embeds an image into our page in the position it appears. It does this via
                        the <code>src</code> (source) attribute, which contains the path to our image file.</p>
                    <p>We have also included an <code>alt</code> (alternative) attribute. In this attribute, you specify
                        descriptive text for users who cannot see the image, possibly because of the following reasons:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>They are visually impaired. Users with significant visual impairments often use tools called
                            screen readers to read out the alt text to them.</li>
                        <li>Something has gone wrong causing the image not to display. For example, try deliberately
                            changing the path inside your src attribute to make it incorrect. If you save and reload the
                            page, you should see something like this in place of the image:</li>
                        <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics/alt-text-example.png" alt="My test image">

                <article>
                    <p><strong>Heading elements</strong> allow you to specify that certain parts of your content are
                        headings — or subheadings. In the same way that a book has the main title, chapter titles, and
                        subtitles, an HTML document can too. HTML contains 6 heading levels,
                        <code>&lt;h1>–&lt;h6></code>, although you'll commonly only use 3 to 4 at most:
                    </p>
                    <pre class="code-center">
&lt;h1>My main title&lt;/h1>
&lt;h2>My top level heading&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3>My subheading&lt;/h3>
&lt;h4>My sub-subheading&lt;/h4>

                <article>
                    <p>Links are very important — they are what makes the web a web! To add a link, we need to use a
                        simple element — <code>&lt;a></code> — "a" being the short form for "anchor". To make text
                        within your paragraph into a link, follow these steps:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Choose some text. We chose the text "Mozilla Manifesto".</li>
                        <li>Wrap the text in an <code>&lt;a></code> element, as shown below:</li>
                        <pre class="code-center">&lt;a>Mozilla Manifesto&lt;/a></pre>
                        <li>Give the <code>&lt;a></code> element an href attribute, as shown below:</li>
                        <pre class="code-center">&lt;a href="">Mozilla Manifesto&lt;/a></pre>
